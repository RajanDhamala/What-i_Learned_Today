Today, I experimented with calling the chess.com API to fetch user information such as rating, title, name, user ID, followers, chess.com profile link, and profile image. Integrating country information from another API into the UI posed challenges due to delays in state updates, affecting the project's functionality. I also deepened my understanding of Tailwind CSS, exploring classes like mx-auto, container, grid-start, and grid-end. It was a valuable learning experience overall.
