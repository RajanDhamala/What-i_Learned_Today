My React Learning Journey
Welcome to my React learning journey! This repository logs my daily progress, the concepts I've mastered, and the challenges I've faced along the way.

Daily Log
2024/07/20
Today, I dove into React Router, learning about Route, Switch, and BrowserRouter. It was fascinating to see how URLs can be managed and elements updated dynamically. I also explored the Link component for smooth navigation. Although I still have some doubts, I'm determined to master these concepts. Let's keep grinding!

2024/07/21
Exams are around the corner, starting tomorrow. I didn't have much time to learn new React concepts today. That's all for now.

2024/07/22
Math exam today, and it went decent. Couldn't dive into React due to exam preparations.

2024/07/23
Java exam today. It was pretty average, so no new React learning today.

2024/07/24
Yesterday was my Operating Systems exam, so I didn't get a chance to learn new React concepts.

2024/07/25
Internet Fundamentals and Applications exam today. Again, no time for React.

2024/07/26
Advanced Computer Networks exam today. Finally started learning Redux, an exciting addition to my React skills.

2024/07/27
Today, I dug deeper into components and got clarity on several topics. Feeling more confident now.

2024/07/28
I created reusable product components similar to those on Daraz, passing different props multiple times. Understanding the props chain concept felt rewarding.

2024/07/29
Learned how to make a responsive website using Tailwind CSS. Explored various breakpoints and implemented a responsive site using components from yesterday. Also, dived into grid layouts and conditional rendering in JSX.

2024/07/30
Today was all about Git! I learned commands to push code into remote repos like GitHub. Also got some ideas about custom hooks in React.

2024/07/31
Created a UI in React where users can type a city name and fetch weather data using an API. Learned a lot about Tailwind CSS. It was a great hands-on experience!

2024/08/01
Fantastic day! I created a weather forecast app that shows 6-day weather data using WeatherAPI. Designed a responsive layout in a single day and attempted to deploy it on Vercel, though it didn't go as expected. Learned more about hooks like useEffect and useCallback.

2024/08/02
Experimented with the chess.com API to fetch user information like ratings, title, name, user ID, followers, and profile link. Integrating country information from another API was challenging due to state update delays. Also explored Tailwind CSS classes like mx-auto, container, grid-start, and grid-end. Overall, a valuable learning experience.

2024/08/03
Today, I focused on pulling and pushing code in new and existing repos, gradually learning Git commands and techniques. Worked on making the weather app more responsive and faced issues with state updates not happening instantly, leading to execution problems in JavaScript. I'm searching for ways to handle this better.
